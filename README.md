# Loop-Order-Matrix-Multiplication-1D
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in various scientific, engineering, and computational fields. Typically performed in two dimensions, matrices can be represented and manipulated as one-dimensional arrays for computational efficiency. This article delves into the impact of loop order on the computation time for matrix multiplication using one-dimensional arrays in C, focusing on why the loop order (i-k-j) results in the highest computation time.
